### **Explanation of the Code:**

The `Solution` class contains a method `sortPeople`, which sorts an array of names based on their corresponding heights, in **descending order** of heights. Here's a breakdown of the code:

---

### **Method Signature:**

```java
public String[] sortPeople(String[] names, int[] heights)
```

* **`names`**: Array of names (strings).
* **`heights`**: Array of heights (integers).
* **Return Value**: The method returns an array of names, sorted in descending order according to their corresponding heights.

---

### **Step-by-Step Explanation:**

#### 1. **Initialization of `mapping` (HashMap):**

```java
Map<Integer, String> mapping = new HashMap<>();
```

* A `HashMap` called `mapping` is created to store the relationship between heights and corresponding names.
* **Key**: Height (integer)
* **Value**: Name (string)

#### 2. **Populate the `mapping` HashMap:**

```java
for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    mapping.put(heights[i], names[i]);
}
```

* A **for loop** iterates over the `names` and `heights` arrays.
* For each index `i`, the height `heights[i]` is mapped to the name `names[i]` in the `mapping` HashMap.
* After this step, each height is associated with the corresponding name in the `mapping` HashMap.

#### 3. **Sort the `heights` array in ascending order:**

```java
Arrays.sort(heights);
```

* **`Arrays.sort(heights)`** sorts the `heights` array in **ascending order** (from smallest to largest height).
* This makes it easier to then reverse the order in the next step.

#### 4. **Reverse the `heights` array to get descending order:**

```java
for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; ++i) {
    int temp = heights[i];
    heights[i] = heights[n - 1 - i];
    heights[n - 1 - i] = temp;
}
```

* A **reverse logic** is applied to the `heights` array.
* The loop swaps the heights at positions `i` and `n - 1 - i`, effectively reversing the array.
* After this step, the `heights` array is in **descending order**.

#### 5. **Assign sorted names based on sorted heights:**

```java
for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    names[i] = mapping.get(heights[i]);
}
```

* A **second loop** iterates through the `heights` array (now sorted in descending order).
* For each height, it looks up the corresponding name from the `mapping` HashMap and assigns it back to the `names` array.
* This step reassigns the names in the order of sorted heights, from tallest to shortest.

#### 6. **Return the sorted names:**

```java
return names;
```

* The method finally returns the `names` array, which is now sorted according to the corresponding `heights` in descending order.

### **Time Complexity:**

1. **Populating the `mapping` HashMap**:

   * This takes **O(n)** time where `n` is the number of elements in the `names` and `heights` arrays.
2. **Sorting the `heights` array**:

   * Sorting the `heights` array takes **O(n log n)** time (because of `Arrays.sort()`).
3. **Reversing the `heights` array**:

   * This takes **O(n)** time since we are swapping the elements.
4. **Filling the `names` array**:

   * This takes **O(n)** time because we iterate over the `heights` array and access each corresponding name from the `mapping` HashMap.

So, the **overall time complexity** is:

```
O(n log n)  // The sorting step dominates.
```

### **Space Complexity:**

* The space complexity is **O(n)** because of the extra storage used by the `mapping` HashMap.

---

### **Possible Optimizations:**

* **Use a custom comparator** for sorting the pairs (names and heights) together, which avoids the need for creating a separate `mapping` HashMap.

  * This could reduce some of the overhead in terms of additional data structures.

---

### **Summary:**

This code sorts a list of names based on their corresponding heights in descending order by:

1. Storing the names and heights in a `HashMap`.
2. Sorting the heights in ascending order.
3. Reversing the sorted heights to make them descending.
4. Mapping the sorted heights back to names.
